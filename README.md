# POS-Database


POS Database ETL, Aggregation, and MongoDB P2P Clustering

Overview

This project focuses on implementing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for a Point of Sale (POS) system database, aggregating key business metrics, and replicating data across a MongoDB P2P (peer-to-peer) cluster. The solution ensures seamless data flow, transformation, and availability across distributed nodes.

Key Features

ETL Pipeline Implementation:

Extraction of transactional data from the POS relational database.

Transformation to optimize data structure and prepare it for analytical workloads.

Loading processed data into a MongoDB cluster for distributed access.

Data Aggregation:

Generation of insightful business reports, including revenue, sales trends, and customer behavior.

Real-time aggregation to support operational dashboards.

MongoDB P2P Clustering:

Replication of data across distributed nodes for high availability and fault tolerance.

Implementation of sharding strategies to optimize query performance.

Ensuring data consistency and synchronization across the cluster.

Technology Stack

Databases:

PostgreSQL/MySQL (Source POS database)

MongoDB (Distributed NoSQL database for storage and aggregation)

ETL Frameworks:

Apache Airflow

Python (Pandas, PyMongo)

Infrastructure & Deployment:

Docker & Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration

AWS/GCP for cloud-based scalability

Project Architecture

Data Extraction:

Extract raw sales, inventory, and customer data from the POS database via SQL queries.

Implement change data capture (CDC) for incremental updates.

Data Transformation:

Cleanse and normalize data for consistency.

Aggregate transactional data to support business intelligence.

Format data to align with MongoDB document structure.

Data Loading:

Insert transformed data into MongoDB collections.

Implement indexing strategies for optimized retrieval.

Data Replication & Clustering:

Setup of a MongoDB replica set for redundancy.

Sharding configurations for horizontal scaling.
